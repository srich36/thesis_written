  abstract = { This research investigates the performance of the particle swarm optimization algorithm in the solution of responsive theater maneuvers, introduced here for the first time. The responsive theater maneuver is designed to alter a spacecraft’s arrival position as it overflies a hazardous geographic region, while still meeting sensor range constraints. The maneuver places the satellite on an exclusion ellipse centered at the spacecraft’s expected arrival position at the expected time of entry into the hazardous region. A global particle swarm optimization algorithm is shown to generate optimal solutions for the single-pass responsive theater maneuver scenario in shorter time frames than local particle swarm variants, a genetic algorithm, and a parameter search. The global particle swarm algorithm is then shown to generate consistent performance in the solution of single-, double-, and triple-pass responsive theater maneuver scenarios for various size exclusion ellipses. }

  abstract = { This paper deals with the problem of spacecraft time-optimal reorientation maneuvers under boundaries and path constraints. The minimum time solution with keep-out constraints is proposed using the particle swarm optimization technique. A novel method based on the evolution of the kinematics and the successive obtainment of the control law is presented and named as inverse dynamics particle swarm optimization. It is established that the computation of the minimum time maneuver with the proposed technique leads to near-optimal solutions, which fully satisfy all the boundaries and path constraints. }
